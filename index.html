                                    <p>
                                        A roguelite game I am working on, where you play as a bacteria trying to survive in a petri dish. The game features a fast paced experience where you fight of bacteria as long as possible becoming the strongest virus you can be.

                            <h3>REAL TIME STRATEGY DEMO</h3>
                                <h4>Unity Old School RTS Tech Demo</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This is a tech demo I made in Unity to test out some ideas for an old school real time strategy game. It features a simple resource gathering system, building and repair system, unit selection, movement, and combat, enemy AI, and enemy wave system. The game is still very much unfinished and buggy but I was able to see the work required to create a bigger project from start to finish. The difference in my approach and understanding of game systems from the beginning to the *end* of the project is night and day. You can check out the project on <a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with the link below.

                                <h4>Dynamic Color Guessing Game</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        wordle like game where you guess the hex code of a color. This was a passion project I made one weekend after showing some friends <a href="https://hexcodle.com/" target="_blank">hexacodle</a> a similar game with only a daily color to guess like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">wordle</a>. I wanted a site where me and my friends could practice as much as we wanted without waiting a day for the new color. This was made with HTML, CSS, and PHP.

                                    <p>
                                        This is a project I made for a course where I had to create a dynamic website with a database. I wanted to make a personal book catalog where I could keep track of the books I have read and want to read. It features a login system, book search, and book management system. It was made with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
